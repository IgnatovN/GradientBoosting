# Gradient Boosting Regreessor
My implementation of Gradient Boosting Regressor from scratch

---

My gradient-boosting algorithm is built over decisive trees with depth-wise method. It uses stochastic gradient descent techique to introduce randomness and diversity into the construction of each tree, which can reduce overfitting and improve the generalizing ability of the model.

#### Performance

---

According to test fit on the same data, my implementation showed the similar accuracy as sklearn's one
